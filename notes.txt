green wall notes
----------------

blurb:
a weirdly addictive arcade game, where you fling fruit against a big green wall.


next up:
 - bug showing splatted fruit!?  where are we leaving a burst flag on??
 - change combo text to btm, with text and image, alpha bg
 - starter icon
 - add spaz to combo?  spaz is 3x multiplier to combo and makes combo spaz harder?
  min number of combos per round -> per 10 levs, combo reqt.  after lev 20, reqt is in a scrqqn quadrant
  targets?  halo looking glow ring, 2x points for anything in target, target had 30% min
  catch phone exit and go bac to title screen.  are you sure?
 make fruit randomly twitch?
